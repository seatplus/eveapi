## Feaures
Provide ability to:
* create POST requests to queue an update job
* use GET requests to query api results
* take advantage of job middlewares
* `auth:api` guarded endpoints to enable usage as api-only as well as web 
* high test coverage (original seat has almost none tests)
* no SDE requirement
